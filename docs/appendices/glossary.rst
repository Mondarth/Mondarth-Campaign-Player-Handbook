     .. rubric:: Example

     Bob (player) hears the |gm| tell Anne (another player) that the sword they found gives off a magical aura. Anne's character 'Milo' is a wizard using a detect magic spell. Bob's character 'Gart' is a barbarian with no magical ability, unless Milo tells Gart that the sword is magical then Gart cannot act on the information (by grabbing the sword for himself even though in normal appearance it is far inferionr to Gart's current weapon). And please don't try the old, 'Gart just wanted a different sword', |gm|'s are quite aware of this BS.
   Nerf
     To decrease in ability. Usually applies to |PC|/|NPC| stats.
