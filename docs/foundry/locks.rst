Picking a lock
--------------

You need 'Thieves' Tools' but once you nave these you can attempt to pick a lock by :kbd:`SHIFT` |and| |RMB|.

.. attention:: Some locks are jammed, some require multiple succesful picks to open, some will break tools (removing them from your inventory and poentially then jambing the lock). So, good luck!

Keys
----

You may find keys as you adventure. These can be used to open the locks to which they belong. Simple approach the lock with your character and |RMB|. If you have the right key in your inventory the lock will open.

Passwords
---------

Some locks open with a password. Approach the lock and |RMB|. You will be challenged for the password. Enter it. If correct the lock opens.


Break a lock
------------

Sometimes brute force is an option. To attempt to break a lock, move your character to the lock and then :kbd:`ALT` |and| |RMB|.
