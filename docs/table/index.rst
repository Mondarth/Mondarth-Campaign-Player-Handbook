Table
=====

Time
----

Please be on time! The session will start at the assigned time with or without you (as with other requests this is to be fair to other players). The table is usually open a few minutes before the session starts to allow people to connect and get settled.

Sessions are scheduled to run for three to four hours. I aim for three and a half but if a natural break occurs after three hours I offer the table the opportunity to stop there. If a session looks like there will be no natural break before the four hour mark then the table can elect to overrun a little\ [#F1]_.

Etiquette
---------

At the table please:

#. Ensure you are ready when it is your turn to take action.

   If you take too long taking an action you will lose that turn as it's unfair to other players to have to wait too long. (The length of time we wait gets shorter as the campaing progesses.)
#. In combat pay attention even if it not your turn.

   The system may alert you to an opportunity attack or some other special action your character can take. These are time sensitive and if you miss them they are gone.
#. If you are eating/drinking please mute your microphone.

   If fact, mute whenever you are not talking if possible.
#. Let other players play their own character. By all means offer occasional advice but *DO NOT* pressure others to play 'your way'.
#. *DO NOT* :term:`metagame <Meta-gaming>` (I will let you know if you do this accidentally but do not do it deliberately, it's rude).

Player on player
----------------

Some players want to fight one another, or steal from other players. While I don't have a blanket ban on this sort of behaviour I would note:

#. It's generally not conducive to a fun table.
#. Players who do this get mad when it is done to them. If you can't take it, don't do it.
#. It rarely achieves anything good in the long run.

.. note:: If the majority want to ban player-on-player actions then I'm okay with enforcing it but I'd hope players at my tables are mature enough to know it's generally a dick move.

.. rubric:: Why not a default ban?

Sometimes two or more players will agree to player-on-player for the sake of the story. For example, two characters fighting an honour duel.

Character Death
---------------

.. important:: This is *ALWAYS* a possibility!

Firstly, death may not be permanent. If your party can get you to a suitable power they may be able to get you resurrected or reincarnated.

This is not the end of the world (though it may seem so if a beloved character dies). If a character dies then I will generally allow players to roll a new character and this  new character will be integrated into the campaign as soom ar practicable.

What about that beloved character that died? Hey, there are other campaigns and a beloved character may fit into one of those. Death across campaigns is not generally a thing.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#F1] 'A little' is deliberately vague but if I have the energy and the table nas the inclination I'm nappy to keep going to a natural break point if one is near. That said, after hour four we aim to halt |ASAP|.
