Players
=======

Basic Expectations
------------------

Not many, mostly common sense/courtesy.

#. Be respectful of other players (including your |gm|).
#. If you cannot make a session let us know as soon as possible so adjustments can be made.
#. Learn how your character works. In this campaign I allow a lot of leeway as I expect some of you will be learning the game or the |FVTT| but even so you will be expected to control your character and figure out how they work\ [#F3]_.

Questioning |gm| decisions
--------------------------

I am happy to have decisions challenged. In fact I expect you as a player to (eventually) know more about how your character's race and class work than I do.

That said...

I allow a little time for challenges (a couple of minutes discussion at the table), after that whatever I rule is the end of the discussion at the table. If you feel that the decision is still wrong then we can continue the discussion in the campaign Discord channel between sessions. If you make a strong enough case I will 'make good' any negative consequence before or during the next session.

This keeps play flowing during the session while allowing the opportunity for redress if I get things wrong (I am only human).


But the rules say...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I play |RAP| (as |FVTT| automation determines). This generally means |RAW| in the 2014 core rule books. But, these rules are still not definitive, are often open to interpretation or ambiguous, or simply do not cover every situation. When all is said and done, the way I interpret the rules at my tables is the 'right' way so please don't be 'that person' who quotes the rule books. The rule books are only guidance (in fact the core rules make this point).

I am however a great believer in the 'rule of cool'. If you want to try something that is not in the rules, or that bends the rules (even breaks them), then if it will result in a better game for all at the table I will likely give it my wholehearted support (I may assign a very high difficulty to it though, so failure is always an option).

Missing Players
---------------

If a player cannot make a session we will adopt one of the following:

#. Player's :ref:`character will 'rest' <rest>` during the session and other players will continue.
#. Missing player will hand control of their character to a :ref:`'proxy' (one of the other players) <op>`.
#. |gm| will, with the players consent, :ref:`control <gmc>` their character through the session.
#. Session will be skipped if everyone agrees.


If a player simply fails to turn up to a session without notice then by default I will 'rest' the character and introduce an |NPC| to :term:`buff` the party for that session\ [#F4]_.

.. _rest:
Character Resting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a character is 'resting' due to player missing the session they will not accrue any experience, nor share in treasure. The character will be considered safe from harm and inactive.

.. _op:
Other player control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A missing player can hand their character to another player on the clear understanding that they will get the character back in whatever state the proxy player leaves it (even dead)\ [#F1]_.

.. _gmc:
|gm| Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: This option it only available for *one* missing player at a time.

Characters controlled by |gm| will take part in the session and be at risk! They will take part in combat. They will gain experience and share in loot.

Characters *will not* initiate any action.

.. attention:: This is not my favourite solution with established characters as players tend to become attached and I have enough else to do running a game without the added stress of keeping a character alive. With low level characters the stakes tend to be low enough to make this reasonable.

.. note:: With other players agreement we can play a 'ratchet' strategy. The |gm| plays the character but if the character dies the player can start the next session with the character as it was when they handed it over (essentially treat it as a 'rested' character). If the character survives the player takes it up in whatever condition it ends the |gm| controlled session in.

Undersized party
----------------

If missing players means the party size drops below the minimum size the remaining players may:

#. Opt to continue regardless :ref:`with small party <small>`.
#. Play :ref:`secondary characters <second>`.

.. _small:
Continuing with small party
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An undersized party may find it difficult in some encounters (running away is frequently the best stategy when outmatched). A small party is still often better than no party and I will do my best to keep sessions going even if only you turn up and want to play.


.. _second:
Secondary Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More experienced players may volunteer to play secondary characters\ [#F2]_.

**This requires the agreement of all other players.**

The secondary character will only 'make up numbers' and will not be playable when the campaign minimum number of players are present.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#F3] For example, magic users should read what their spells do and how they work (I make resources available through both |ddb| and within |FVTT| to help with this).
.. [#F4] |NPC| party members are not ideal but better that screwing a whose session.
.. [#F1] No 'ratchet' operates as in the |gm| control option. The only reason for the |gm| ratchet is to avoid |gm| overload.
.. [#F2] I'll figure a way for them to come and go (just as I will with the missing player).
