Introduction
============

This is not a complete manual for Foundry. Here I am just covering a few features of my |FVTT| installation that may be different to others you have experienced.

Automation
----------

I am a big fan of automating as much of the game mechanics as possible. You will find that, especially in combat, the system will do a lot of heavy lifting. Rolling attacks and then, on a hit, automatically rolling damage.

Animation
~~~~~~~~~

Lots of weapons and spells show animations on screen and play sound effects.

Sound
~~~~~

Sound can be important. Listen carefully as you move about. When your character is selected you will hear the environment around them. You may pick up clues (especially if you move close to doors and windows where you may hear what is happening on the other side).

Dice rolls
~~~~~~~~~~

You initiate rolls (like an attack roll in combat) and |FVTT| will determine advantage/disadvantage, make the attack roll, then roll and apply damage on a hit.
