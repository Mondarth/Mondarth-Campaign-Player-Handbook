Cover
=====

D&D 5e has a fairly sophisticated system of cover during combat. Creatures, |NPC|\s, and |PC|\s can take cover behind one another or the environment. Rules for cover also account for a characters vision (if you cannot see a target clearly because there is low light then it is considered under cover).

Bottom-line, if you suddenly find your rolling with disadvantage then it is probably a cover issue.

During combat you will see small shields appear on potential targets as you move. Not shield means you have a clear shot. A half coloured shield means half-cover and a quarter panel shield means three quarter. I the shield is solid colour then the target is fully under cover.
