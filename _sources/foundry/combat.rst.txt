Combat Grid
===========

When you are in combat more information will be available on the scene. This information is displayed for the selected character and sometimes only when the character is moved.

You will see your distance to potential target along with an indication of their :ref:`cover`.

Green squares around your character will show the range of your current primary weapon.

Yellow squares show the long range for a ranged weapon.

Hovering your mouse over a token will show an indication of its current health.
