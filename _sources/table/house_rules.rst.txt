House Rules
===========

Here are a few notes on homebrew or points where my interpretation of specific |RAW| may conflict with the norm.

Combat
------

For the most part I leave rulings on combat rolls to |RAP| (the rules as programmed in my FoundryVTT). With very few exceptions these are |RAW| in the 2014 core rules\ [#F1]_.

Death saves
~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally I don't do death saves until after characters reach 3rd level. This is for two reasons:

#. Low level characters are very squishy and easily killed. I like to give characters a chance to survive until they are more adventurer than aspiring adventurer.
#. Players are often less experienced and Death Saves is a complication we can dispense with without compromising play.

If the table disagree then I am happy to roll death saves at lower levels.

When rolling death saves you roll your first save on the next combat turn where you have 0 hit points starting on the round *after* the one where you were rendered unconscious. Suppose Bob the barbarian is 4th in initiative order and a Bugbear in 2nd initiative order reduces Bob to 0 hit points during round 3 of combat, Bob *does not* roll a save during round 3. Bob rolls his first death save on his turn in round 4.

.. note::
   My rationale for this is that a turn in combat is 6 seconds of basically simultaneous action. All combatant's turns start and end on the same 6 second period. So, the Bugbear rendering Bob unconscious is the Bugbears action and Bob 'becoming unconscious' is his 'action' this round (the result of a potentially mortal blow).  Death saves are, |IMO|, a mechanic representing bleeding out and the loss of hit points is the potentially mortal blow. Rolling a death save in the same round as the mortal blow strikes me as a double accounting, essentially 'the mortal blow and a check for bleeding out' in the same turn.

   Looking at it another way. If the Bugbear's initiative put it 5th in order then Bob would have already acted and his first Death Save would naturally fall in the following round. It seems grossly unbalanced to force a character to do a death save just because of initiative order.

Unconscious characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to death saves, when you reach 0 hit points and fall unconscious (assuming you don't die outright) you roll 1d4 hours in which you will be unconscious. During this time you are effectively out of the game (which sucks, but them's the breaks).

These 'unconscious' hours start from the time you fall unconscious. So if your party get you to safety and take a long rest (or enough short rests to cover your time unconscious) you regain consciousness and benefit from the long/short rest.

To me this seems common sense. Your unconscious state is not 'additional' it is simply 'you are out cold for 1d4 hours', where you are during that time does not effect the duration.



Magic System
------------

Scrolls
~~~~~~~

These disintegrate when the spell is cast, this much is clear in the |RAW|. A wizard can transfer the spell to their spell book, also clear (takes two hours of study and 50gp---25gp for higher level wizard). The |RAW| is not clear on what happens to the scroll under these circumstances. I am applying the logic of `Mondarth's magic system <https://codex.mondarth.com/wiki/Magic_System_(Core)>`_ as applied to `scrolls <https://codex.mondarth.com/wiki/Scrolls,_spell_books,_etc.>`_.

.. rubric:: Summary

Here 'script' refers to any symbolic record of a spell (scroll, spell book, etc.).

.. dropdown:: Can I copy a script?

   Yes if you are a skilled magic user. Copying takes time, skill, and sometimes resources. You will always need appropirate materials (simple ink and parchment are rarely suitable to contain a magical script).

   The higher the level of the script being tansfered the more effort required. If your |gm| is in a generous mood they may give some indication of what is needed at the outset.

   Copying a foreign script (not your own) requires more time and effort as you must first understand the script, how the spell works, and how to safely transcribe it into your own script.

   Copying your own script still requires care and time but is less risky and quicker than transcribing a forieign script.

.. dropdown:: What happens to a copied script?

   It depends. If copying your own script (i.e. making a copy of your own spell book) then nothing happens if you successfully make the copy.

   If copying a foreign script (any script not written by you) then it may disintegrate completely, the script may vanish, or it may remain but become inert. Which happens will depend on the specifics of these script being copied, ask your |gm|.

.. dropdown:: What is an inert script?

   An inert script appears to be a normal script but cannot be copied or cast from. To discover if you have an inert script you need to study it, as if copying it normally. Your |gm| will let you know the outcome.

.. dropdown:: Can I cast directly from a script?

   Yes. Any script can be used to cast from directly with no preparation. However this *always* renders the script inert, regardless of whether it is your own or a foreign script.

   This means you could cast direct from your own spell book a spell you have not prepared but you would essentially burn that spell and have no access to it in future.




.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#F1] There are odd ocassions where you were get a roll with advantage or disadvantage that seems puzzling. On the whole I just roll with these as almost without exception when I have dug into how the system arrived at this outcome it has proven correct (often something like cover offered by lack of light, some arcane little used ability, or a size difference between opponents). The time it takes to figure this out would just slow things down too much, so consider these |gm| decisions and move on unless you feel especially unfairly treated.
